Make an Arbitrary Song Curative: Therapeutic Music Transfer for Anxiety Reduction Based on Melody and Accompaniment: supplementary document


This document is designed to assist with reading supplementary materials of the paper “Make an Arbitrary Song Curative: Therapeutic Music Transfer for Anxiety Reduction Based on Melody and Accompaniment”. In this document, we describe therapeutic music used in our experiment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed model can generate therapeutic music based on the input music.

1. THERAPEUTIC MUSIC LIST
We shows a list of therapeutic music that is mentioned in [1] and is adopted in this paper.

• Moon River (Henry Mancini)
• Watermark (Enya Patricia Brennan)
• Carmen Suite No.1, Intermezzo (George Bizet)
• Morning Mood (Edvard Grieg)
• Eine kleine Nachtmusik (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
• The Swan (Saint-Saens)
• Pie Jesu (Gabriel Fauré)
• Piano Concerto No.21, K.467 - 2nd movement (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
• Clarinet Concerto in A major, K.622 - 2nd movement (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
• Gabriel’s Message (Basque Folk Carol)


2. MUSIC DEMONSTRATION
We demonstrate two music examples from Fig. 3 and Fig. 12. In the first demonstration, we show original music examples, stitched music examples and transferred music examples. In the second
demonstration, we show that music transferred by different melody-accompaniment weights brings different feelings.
