# Make a Song Curative: A Spatio-temporal Therapeutic Music Transfer Model for Anxiety Reduction: supplementary document

This document is designed to assist with reading supplementary materials of the paper “Make a Song Curative: A Spatio-temporal Therapeutic Music Transfer Model for Anxiety Reduction: supplementary document”. In this document, we describe therapeutic music used in our experiment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed model can generate therapeutic music based on the input music.
